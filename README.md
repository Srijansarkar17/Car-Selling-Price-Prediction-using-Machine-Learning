This Machine Learning Model is created using polynomial regression algorithm.
THE STEP BY STEP PROCESS FOLLOWED TO TRAIN THE MODEL ARE :
1. Download and load the dataset
2. Data Preparation and Cleaning
3. Changing the column values of dataset for model training
4. Data Visualisation
5. Splitting the dataset
6. Evaluating the model for training data(used Polynomial Regression)
7. Scope for improvement

Scope for improvement:
We tried our best to clean the data but the dataset is too variable. That is why the R sqaured error came out to be around 0.70. We will look into it and work for further improvement. Next time we will be careful to choose a proper dataset and clean more thoroughly.
